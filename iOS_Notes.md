<!-- Tools Needed for iOS App Creation  --> 
1. XCode 

<!-- XCode Interface: Starting Application -->

1. Create new project 
2. Product Name - Application Title
3. Organization Name - Your name or company name
4. Organization Identifier - this is the reverse domain (i.e. helloworld.com would be com.helloworld)
5. Language - Swift or Objective-C

<!-- XCode Interface: Inside Application --> 

1. Status Bar - across the top of page
2. Play/Stop button - top left of page

  - stop, will stop project from running 
3. To determine where you want your project to run, click on the button to the right of stop button - will have the application name displayed
  - once clicked, a drop down menu will appear and you can select which device to run project on 
4. Status bar - top middle of page - shows status of project, i.e. running, or any errors, etc. 
5. Standard Editor - 1st button on top right of page with blue lines 
  - this is usually selected by default - this refers to the middle part of the page displays as a single screen in "standard" mode
6. Assistant Editor - button to the right of Standard Editor, with two circles  - this splits the screen into two screens (similar to Brackets vertical split)
7. Version Editor - this allows you to see previous versions of your code - can compare and contrast versions
8. Navigator Button - located on top right of page, next to editor buttons
  - will hide or show left side navigation pane

  - the majority of the time you'll spend in Project navigator mode, which displays your file structure on the left side bar
