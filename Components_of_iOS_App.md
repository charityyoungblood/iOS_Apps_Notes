<!-- What's in iOS --> 

1. Components of iOS
  - Core OS: hardware - iPhone runs a version of UNIX  
  - Core Services: Object oriented services on top of Core OS 
  - Media: Multimedia 
  - Cocoa Touch: Object Oriented API for building user interfaces  

2. XCode

  - The "use core data" option that is listed when creating a new project is referring to implementation of databases 
  - for a list of shortcut keys, click on Xcode at top right of screen > Preferences > Key Bindings 
  - Assets: media files 
  - Modules: UIKit, other Apple Modules that come with Swift 
  - When calling a function, remember the first argument/parameter is the variable name, the second has to include the keyword/name of the argument 
    Ex: self.pradaDress(dressButton, dressCost: 2000)
  - To connect multiple buttons, use the drag and select method 


MVC
  - Model - the model is what controls the data; it manipulates the data and prepares the data to be served up to the View Controller
  - View - what appears on screen 
    - this includes buttons, labels, text or images 
  - Controller - this is what goes on behind the scenes 
    - the code that controls what should happen when the user taps a button 
    - also includes the code that controls what should happend when you have a piece of data to display on screen
