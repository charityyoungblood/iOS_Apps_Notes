<!-- This file highlights how to structure your projects-->

1. Look up what type of framework/library/module iOS has to help implement your code 
  i.e. for tapping into the user's location - iPhone GPS - use CoreLocation
  
2. When creating your projects, think about how you want the data displayed - this will help you when you create your data models, as well as when you create objects from those models, and create your functions
