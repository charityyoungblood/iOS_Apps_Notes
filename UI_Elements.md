<!-- Adding Images to your Projects -->

1. When adding images to your projects, you'll need to open the image folder, keep it in a small window 
2. In XCode, click on the Assets folder, on the left side of screen (located inside projects folder)
3. Click on "Appicon"
4. Based on image sizes, drag and drop image files into the Appicon window on right side - There is an overview of this process in the iOS Developer course (with Angela Yu), Section 2.15

<!-- Pixels vs Points --> 

1. One pixel = One Point in a regular screen 
2. On a retina screen, One Point = 4 Pixels - which is a much higher resolution 
3. The point is a length of measure that doesn't change 
4. The app does not support 1X images - these images will look blurry as the image size increases 
5. When creating your own images assets for app icons, be sure to take note of the size that is required (apple documentation) start off with the largest size, then scale down in photo shop
