<!-- Networking - Computer Network  -->

1. Computer Networking - to facilitate the communication between our app and the specified API's servers
2. HTTP Request 
  - When your browser tries to fetch something from a website, i.e. an image, it's making an HTTP request 
  - It sends the request to the website's servers that host that image and that server responds with a file, which then gets displayed in the browser 
  - Browsers are able to manage these requests and responses 
  - Cocoapods >> Alamofire - this is a library of code that will help you make the HTTP requests and simplifying a lot of the networking calls for us
  - this library enables us to make a request with only a few lines of code, instead of having to worry about what to do if the server times out, or if there are connection issues - that is all handled by Alamofire
